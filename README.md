## What is the GigaAPI?

This API is a user-space API that is designed to abstract multiple GPUs as a singular, 
powerful computing resource. This API aims to simplify the utilization of parallel computing 
resources, enabling a user creating an application to leverage multiple GPUs for improved 
performance without the complexity that the traditionally associated with multi-GPU programming 
or just learning CUDA in general. This is merely a proof of concept, to show that a generalizable
API for parallism can be advantageous to developers. 

Again, this is a project that is a proof of concept to incentivize future researchers to
flesh out general purpose user-space APIs to make multi-GPU programming more trivial.

## 3 Styles of Parallelism

### Basic Operations (3 subtasks)

### Images (3 subtasks)

### Machine Learning (3 subtasks)
